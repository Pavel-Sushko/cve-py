# CVE Tracker

CVE Tracker is a Python project that allows users to track Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) from the National Vulnerability Database (NVD). The project fetches data from the NVD and stores it in a database for easy access and analysis.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Pavel-Sushko/cve-tracker.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd cve-tracker`
3. Install the required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Set up the database: `python manage.py migrate`
5. Run the project: `python manage.py runserver`

## Usage

Once the project is running, you can access the web interface at `http://localhost:8000/cve/`. From there, you can search for CVEs by keyword, date range, severity, and more.

You can also access the API at `http://localhost:8000/api/cve/`. The API allows you to fetch data on all CVEs, individual CVEs, and CVEs that match certain criteria.
